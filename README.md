# SetTripsToSaved
<h4>Fix XT routing</h4>

# Background
The motorcycle navigation unit from Garmin, the zumo® XT, is a great unit. But it's routing is not always appreciated,
this holds true especially for trips <b>imported</b> from an external program like Basecamp or MyRoute App. Trips <b>saved</b> on the Xt itself behave better.
The programs in this repository can change a trip from <b>imported</b> to <b>saved</b>, thereby fixing the routing.

# The code

<h4>Java</h4>

   The Java code can be compiled with Eclipse. https://www.eclipse.org
   The generated .jar can be used on Windows, Linux and Mac. This version can also be found on Zumo User Forums: https://www.zumouserforums.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=2301

<h4>Delphi</h4>

  The Delphi version can only be used on Windows, but it has advantages over the Java version.
  It can be compiled with the (free) Delphi Community Edition. https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter

  - It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI). No need for typing commands.
  - It shows more info.
  - It can replace the files directly on the XT.

<h4>CBuilder</h4>

  This is only a Cbuilder project. The source code is the same as the Delphi version.
